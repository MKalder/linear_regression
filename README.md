# Linear Regression - Diamonds

## Introduction

This repository contains a straightforward example of how to create a simple linear regression model using Python. Linear regression is a fundamental concept in the field of machine learning, specifically in supervised learning. In this example, we will use the built-in diamond dataset provided by Seaborn to train a linear regression model and make price predictions based on carat.

## Installation

To run this code locally, you'll need Python and the following libraries installed:

- [NumPy](https://numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/)
- [Seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas seaborn
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/linear-regression.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd linear-regression
```

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook file:

To run a Jupyter Notebook file, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab installed. If you haven't installed it yet, you can install it using pip:

   ```bash
   pip install jupyterlab
   ```

2. Navigate to the directory containing your `linear_regression.ipynb` file using the command line.

3. Start Jupyter Notebook or Jupyter Lab by running either of the following commands:

   For Jupyter Notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

   For Jupyter Lab:

   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

4. Your web browser should open with the Jupyter interface. In the Jupyter interface, navigate to your `linear_regression.ipynb` file and open it.

5. You can now execute the code cells in the notebook and interact with the notebook as you normally would when working with Jupyter Notebook files.

Remember that Jupyter Notebook files are meant for interactive coding and data analysis, and you should use the Jupyter environment to run and work with them.
